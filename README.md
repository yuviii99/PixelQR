# PixelQR

The goal of the project was to create an application using which event hosts can provide images to the people that attended the event in a personalised way.

The primary focus was to maintain privacy of the users by tagging the images with a unique ID so that only the person with the ID can access the images.

## Technologies Used
- Python3 to write a script that generated uuid4 QR Codes for a specific Event Name.
- Python3 & Flask to create the backend server for the application.
- HTML, CSS to create the User Interface.

## Usage: 

- Run `generator.py` to create QR Codes with Unique ID

![](images/generator)

This will generate the QR Codes with Unique ID.

![](images/qr-gen)

- Run `app.py` and go to the admin panel to upload the images

![](images/admin)

- Go to the user panel and enter the code generated by scanning the QR

![](images/user)

- You should be able to see the images uploaded for the specific ID

![](images/final)

## Final Remarks

- This project can be further customised as needed such as customise the UI for each user, give additional data about the event/future events.
- To make it run faster, it can be hosted on the cloud and the Unique ID copy-paste can be done automatically within the URL to streamline the process.
